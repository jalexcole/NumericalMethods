# NumericalMethods

This package is a list of numerical methods done in kotlin primarily for jvm with minimal dependencies with the goal of working with kotlin-native.

## TODO
1. Add documentation and tests.
2. Add support for 2d surface operations and fitting.
3. Create API with a easy to pass around object similar to the numpy object in scipy


## Future goals
1. Add support for handling kmath objects https://github.com/mipt-npm/kmath
2. Add support for jvm vector extensions in java 16 under JEP 338 https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/338
3. Add support for native with handling vector extensions through compiled libraries such as RustFFT https://crates.io/crates/rustfft/5.0.0-experimental.1
